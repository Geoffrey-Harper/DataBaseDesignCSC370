(1) Phase 1: 

* The program features an interactive menu that allows users to
  effectively navigate through all queries from A#3. The formatting of
  most of the queries output is practical.

  facilitate readability.

  campaign at any step of the setup process.

---P3

---P4

* The information being presented to the user is being communicated
  properly and might be useful for understanding and analyzing the
  participation of members in campaigns/events.

  new column for indicating whether a member of a campaign has too
  much work to do.
